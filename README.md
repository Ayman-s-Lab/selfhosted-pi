in this project i have created a self hosted pi that can be used to host many services and applications.
This is a list of services and web applications can be hosted on your own server(s) too .
dont forget to give this project a star‚≠ê to support me.

## First Steps

- install the raspbian os on your sd card.
  you can follow this tutorial from [2:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyMpI8csWis&t=1304s) ‚è© prep the Raspberry Pi.
- connect the raspberry pi to your wifi network.
- ssh into the raspberry pi using the ssh command.

```
ssh pi@ipaddress
```

- update and upgrade the system using the command below.

```
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```

- and reboot the system.

```
sudo reboot
```

congratulations you have now installed the raspberry pi.

- now you can install the following software.

sudo apt install nvim
    ...
        ...
            ...
```

### installing docker

### installing portainer
portainer is a web application that can be used to manage and easily deploy your docker containers .

to install portainer, open th installation-scripts folder and run the install script.
